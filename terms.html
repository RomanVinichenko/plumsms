             Itransition delivered an eLearning platform based on Odoo. The solution allows for organizing online lectures, conducting tests and surveys, and selecting schools to participate in the program, as well as enabling teacher-student communication and online meetings. The platform also has features for document management, including e-signature, billing, and report generation. Finally, we built a new website and customized it to serve as a client portal facilitating school onboarding and course management.
           </p>
           <h3>Discovery</h3>
           <p>
             Itransition’s team managed to complete the discovery phase in a couple of weeks instead of a month as initially planned. We reviewed the customer’s school and teacher onboarding workflow, the overall educational process, and the functionality of their current LMS. We also thoroughly examined the customer’s business processes and visualized them in the form of diagrams.
           </p>
           <p>
             Eventually, we figured out that the customer needed a full-blown ERP system instead of an LMS, open-source and easily customizable in line with the project’s needs. The speed of implementation was also an important consideration since the platform was expected to be launched in time for the upcoming academic year.
           </p>
           <p>
             Our team analyzed around 10 ERP/LMS solutions comparing them based on 30+ available features. Eventually, we picked the four best-fitting options, among which were Moodle, Odoo Community (CE) and Odoo Enterprise (EE), and LifterLMS, a WordPress-based LMS.
           </p>
           <p>
             Having compared the solutions, we concluded that the system built on top of the Odoo ERP platform was the best solution as it matched the customer’s requirements and allowed the customer to get started quickly and at a comparably low cost. We also chose Odoo Enterprise for its full-fledged accounting features and an in-built electronic document signature feature.
           </p>
           <p>
             What is more, Odoo Enterprise can be hosted on the Odoo.sh dedicated cloud platform, so we could deploy the eLearning platform in a couple of clicks. Last but not least, being an Odoo Silver Partner, Itransition has already developed wide expertise in implementing and customizing Odoo solutions.
